# GOALS ARE SIMPLE

All I want to do is be able to spin up a data architecture and use it fast.

### Priorities
* docker-compose development environments for different databases
* Rust CLI
* Build a fuck load of redundancies and learn how to use several languages together
* GoLang migrations(using [goose](https://github.com/pressly/goose))
* Node API(maybe switch this to gin-gonic at some point)

### NICE BUT UNECESSARY

* graphQL test endpoints
* graphical stuff
* Fancier terminal things.
* Implement a UI for SQL using [sqlpad](https://github.com/rickbergfalk/sqlpad)
